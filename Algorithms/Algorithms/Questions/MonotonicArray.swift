 Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean
 representing whether the array is monotonic.

 An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
 entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

 Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing; they simply
 don't increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily
 exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.
 
 Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.
 
 e.g.
 array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]
 -> true
